There will be a website where users can log in, see and edit their list of searches. A search will consist of a subreddit and a search term. Users will have up to three searches (for now). 
Users will also be able to sign up (with their email?). Users will be able to log in and log out.
There will be an admin portal, where an admin user can log in and (maybe?) see the searches lists of other users, and see the history (maybe?) of notification emails that have gone out.
